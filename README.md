## Clarifications

#### Why a heartbeat

Mavrouter will only route traffic with a header.system_id to a connection that is sending messages with that system_id. So sending the same heartbeat as a receiving system_id will allow for sniffing all their incoming messages. Also, if SnifferSysId is set in mavrouter and a connection sends a heartbeat with that system_id, that connection will receive all traffic.

#### Why output to binary

The mavlink connection can also be made on .bin files, all the messages are then read and parsed correctly. This enabled the replay functionality.
